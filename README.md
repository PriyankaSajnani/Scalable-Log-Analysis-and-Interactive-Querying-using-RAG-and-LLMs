# Scalable-Log-Query-Analysis-Using-RAG-and-BERT
Developed an AI-driven log analysis system for scalable anomaly detection in large-scale environments. Implemented a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using T5-large embeddings for intelligent log querying. Built a BERT-based chatbot to interpret critical error logs and derive root-cause insights using causality analysis.
